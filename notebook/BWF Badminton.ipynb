    "In one tournament, there are 8 seed players and some unranked players. To discretize the ranking spread, we chose 12th as the rank for all unranked players. The spread is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spread (from 1st player perspective) = Rank(2nd player) - Rank(1st player)**\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spread(from 1st rank player to 8th rank player) = 8 - 1 = 7\n",
    "* Spread(from 2nd rank player to unrank player) = 12 - 2 = 10\n",
    "* Spread(from unrank player to 3rd rank player) = 3 - 12 = -9\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete space for ranking spread is then **[-11,-10,-9,...,9,10,11]**\n",

    "4. Lose Win Win  -> Win\n",
    "5. Win Lose Win  -> Win\n",
    "6. Win Win       -> Win \n",

    "* win degree\n",
    "\n",
    "To formulate the observations as a one dimensional space collection, we need to reduce the matrix 23x6 (23 different spreads, 6 different win degrees) of all possible raw observations. The intuition of the reduction is as follows:\n",
    "* With the same ranking spread, higher win degree correlates to higher value (see arrow A in image below)\n",
    "* With the same win degree, lower ranking spread correlates to higher value (see arrow B in image below)\n",
    "* Step between value is 1\n",
    "\n",
    "With the given constraint, we will have **46 possible values of observation from [1,46]**. The mapping is as follow (columns are win degrees and rows are ranking spreads)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Analysing the problem\n",

    "The analysis problem is the distribution of observations and how they differ between different tournaments. Furthermore, we will also try and the analyze the affect of different models and priors choice.\n"
