    "### 2.1 Discretizing the problem\n",
    "In one tournament, there are 8 seed players and some unranked players. To discretize the ranking spread, we chose 12th as the rank for all unranked players. The spread is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spread (from 1st player perspective) = Rank(2nd player) - Rank(1st player)**\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spread(from 1st rank player to 8th rank player) = 8 - 1 = 7\n",
    "* Spread(from 2nd rank player to unrank player) = 12 - 2 = 10\n",
    "* Spread(from unrank player to 3rd rank player) = 3 - 12 = -9\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete space for ranking spread is then **[-11,-10,-9,...,9,10,11]**\n",
    "\n",
    "A match (which has at most 3 games) has 6 possible outcomes:\n",
    "1. Lose Lose     -> Lose\n",
    "2. Lose Win Lose -> Lose\n",
    "3. Win Lose Lose -> Lose\n",
    "4. Lose Win Win  -> Win\n",
    "5. Win Lose Win  -> Win\n",
    "6. Win Win       -> Win \n",
    "\n",
    "To discretize this parameter, we map the outcome of a match to **[1,2,3,4,5,6]** in terms of win degree (i.e. win degree 1 is the worst, and win degree 6 is the best)\n",

    "An observation of a match includes 2 pieces of information:\n",
    "* ranking spread\n",
    "* win degree\n",
    "\n",
    "To formulate the observations as a one dimensional space collection, we need to reduce the matrix 23x6 (23 different spreads, 6 different win degrees) of all possible raw observations. The intuition of the reduction is as follows:\n",
    "* With the same ranking spread, higher win degree correlates to higher value (see arrow A in image below)\n",
    "* With the same win degree, lower ranking spread correlates to higher value (see arrow B in image below)\n",
    "* Step between value is 1\n",
    "\n",
    "With the given constraint, we will have **46 possible values of observation from [1,46]**. The mapping is as follow (columns are win degrees and rows are ranking spreads)\n",

    "<img src=\"mapping3.jpg\" alt=\"mapping\" style=\"width: 400px; margin-left: 0\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Analysing the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis problem is the distribution of observations and how they differ between different tournaments. Furthermore, we will also try and the analyze the affect of different models and priors choice.\n"

Once the common mean distribution has been computed and the data has been fitted, the learned $theta[j]$ and $sigma$ values can be used to compute the log-likelihood values of each observation ($N=30$) for every posterior draw ($S$).

Therefore, this process may more accurately be labeled as a _mixed_ PPMC. Drawing $\\theta_j$ from the posterior would make double use of the data which may yield a conservative test (that often fails detect model misfit) since the observed data can have strong influence on the replicated data [@marshall2003approximate; @Vehtari2015efficient].
